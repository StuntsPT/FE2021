## Social Networks

---

### Social networks

* People connected that can infect someone else
* AKA - a graph
  * Each person is a "node"
  * Connections are "meshes"
* This is like a road where the disiese can travel
* Each disiese has it's own social network
* Some networks are similar (Eg. DSTs)
* Flu is very different from Malaria
* Contact tracing
  * Be on the case very early
  * Identify all the contact a case has had in the recent past
  * Follow up with all the contacts (quarenten, etc)
  * 2014 Ebola
  * 2015 MERS
  * Used to cut off potentially infected nodes from further progressing the infection chain
  * This is hard to get data - very hard ot measure; resource intensive; doesn't scale
    * Schools, houseolds, hospitals, can be mapped
    * Can be used as proxies to a population
    * More efficient ways to map these networks are needed; dive deeper into social network structure

### Network structure

* Knowing the network strucure helps understand how to best control a disiese
* We can reduce their complexity by loking at general network structural proprieties
* **Degree distribution** - The degree of a node, is the number of edges it has
 * Count the number of edges at each node, and look at the distribution of these degrees over the entire network (histogram)
 * Example network - 500 nodes and 2500 edges
   * Get the degree of each node
   * Build an histogram of degree frequency
   * How does this affect R0?
     * Get any random node as the first infected
     * Figure the probability of disease transmission per contact (L * Beta = Per contact probability)
   * A High degree aids the spread of a disease
   * If every node had the same degree, R0 = L * Beta * K, where K = average degree
   * In reality, not everyone has the same number of contacts though
   * When all else is equal, UP(Variance) leads to UP(R0)
   * R0 = Beta * L * K * (1 + sigma²/K²)
     * Example where increasing degree variance leads to a much higher R0
     * This is why understanding the social network is so important
     * **Reducing the number of contacts, or reducing the variance of degree are both ways to reduce R0
     * An efficient strategy it to target nodes with very high degrees

Exercício: Dar um social network, pedir para identificar os nodes melhores para isolar de forma a reduzir o R0

## Superspreaders

* When disease parameters are considered the same, it is assumed there is an homegenity across the population of susceptibles;
  * Individual variaton is of lesser importance in face of the larger epidemic
* But this might, in fact, not be true. There can be a great deal of variation in the number of secondary infections generated by an infeccious host
  * Long infectious period
  * Shed a large number of pathogens
  * Or they have many contacts
* Mary Malone - Typhoid Mary (assymptomatic carrier)
* 38 years!
* She was a cook and did not have the habit of washing her hands
  * She was a cook, people became ill and she'd move on to a new job, infecting more people
* A superspreader (50 confirmed infections)
  * Term was coined during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak
  * First cas was an airline steward, who brought the infection from Hong Kong, and infectd her friends, family and priest, most of whom died
  * Another individual she had infected, infected 143 individuals, including **all** doctors and nurses that treated her
  * Most other people hardly infected anyone else
  * Statistically, what would we call the expectation for the frequency distrubution of secondary cases per affected host?
    * At first, this may look like a random distribution - some individuals infect none, others, few. (Wrong!)
    * Unfair distribution - a small number of individuals caused the majority of secondary cases, but most individuals don't infect anyone
    * Similar pattern to measles, monkeypox, smallpox, pneumonic plague among others
    * Kind of common
  * Two very important consequences:
    * When the highly infectious individuals are also the most susceptible - infection spreads very fast (High R0)
    * If we can identify spreader traits, these few individuals can be targetted for treatment or intervention

## Spatial Hereogenity

* Cities as arenas for evolution and ecology of human infections
* Island-mainland metapopulation dynamics
* Hierarchical diffusion
  * can be predicted by "gravity models of human mobility"

---

## Movement and modern transportation

* Enemy release
  * Movement to new places often reduces disease burden
* The British made ameican natives gifts of blankets from smallpox hospitals...
