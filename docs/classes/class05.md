## Epidemiology for the (slightly) intiated

---

## Social Networks and Targeted Vaccination

* Vaccination can profit a lot from social networking monitorization, especially in resource constrained situations
* This becomes especially important when vaccine supply is limited
  * Logistics
  * You can't distribuite it overnight
  * Development is expensive
  * Big problem in pandemic scenarios
* Who should get the first doses? (Brace yourself)
  * Groups who suffer the most?
  * Young people first? (Saves more years of life)
  * Those who if vaccinated would contribute the most to stop the disease spreading?
  * Moral and ethical implications come into play here
* **Efficacy** POV
  * "Given a social network relevant for the transmission of a disease, and a limited supply of vaccines, which nodes should you vaccinate in order to maximum impact disease spread reduction?"
  * Example in [video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics/lecture/dFBjP/social-networks-and-targeted-vaccination) 2:55
  * Consider "centrality", and number of links
* Once again, keep in mind that efficacy is not the only metric to consider

## Vaccine refusal

* Lancet 1998 paper (retracted due to fraud) linked MMR vaccine to Autism
* Clustering of unvaccinated individuals
  * Local outbreaks
  * Social network example in [video ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics/lecture/lkME1/vaccination-refusal) 3:00
  * May 2011 and April 2012 -  Meseles outbreak due to clustering of anti-vax individuals
