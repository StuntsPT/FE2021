### In depth: Case-control studies

---

### When are they useful?

* Associate exposure to an outcome
* Go from effect to cause
* Assess if exposure is equivalently distributed between cases and controls
* **Is exposure a risk factor for the outcome?**
* Especially useful for rare diseases

---

### Study design

* Propose a hypothesis that links an outcome to an exposure
* Select a population to study
* Form one group of subjects exhibiting the outcome (cases)
* Form another group of subjects not exhibiting the outcome (controls)
* Compare exposure data proportions

---

### Data processing

* Case-control studies data is typically organized in 2X2 tables:

![Case-control table](C03_assets/c-c_table.png)

* Data from these tables is then used to calculate:
 * ~~Risk Ratio~~
 * Odds Ratio
* Controls are representative of **a sample** of the population-at-risk
 * Risk measure denominator (population-at-risk) is unknown
* Number of cases and controls are set during design phase
 * Ratio of controls to cases is not biologically meaningful

Eventually add example for OR interpretation

### Types of case-control studies

* Case-control studies can be categorized:
 * When cases develop outcome
 * How controls are sampled

### Depending on outcome development

<div style="float:left; width:50%;" class="fragment">

#### Prevalence studies

* Subjects who **were existing cases** of the outcome during observation period
 * Influenced by incidence rate and survival or migration
* Preferred if studying disease duration

</div>

<div style="float:Right; width:50%;" class="fragment">

#### Incidence studies

* Subjects who **newly develop** the outcome during the observation period
* Preferred if studying disease causes

### Controls selection

* One of the hardest problems in Case-control studies
* Three most frequent approaches:
 1. Base or case-base sampling
 2. Cumulative density or survivor sampling
 3. Incidence density or risk set sampling

### Base or case-base sampling

* Controls selected from the source population
 * Every subject has the same inclusion chance
* Requires a previously defined cohort
* Controls selected after cases are observed
* OR provides a valid estimate for RR

### Cumulative density or survivor sampling

* Controls are sampled from subjects without the outcome
 * Not every subject can be included
* Controls cannot ever become cases
* Controls selected after cases are observed
* OR estimates the RR only if outcome is rare

### Incidence density or risk set sampling

* Cases are incident cases
* Controls are selected from population at the same time cases occur 
 * Controls can become cases if outcome manifests during the study
* OR provides a valid estimate for RR
* Estimates are not biased by differential loss to follow up
 * Exposed subjects leaving the population do not cause bias

### Source populations

* Should be restricted to a population of particular interest
 * E.g. [Serum carotenoids protect against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/10/11/1219.long) (Southwestern American Indian women)
 * Avoid confounders
 * The more specific the group, the less generalizable the conclusions
* Controls should represent the restricted source population from which cases arise, not the total population
* Cases do not have to include all cases in the total population

### Sourcing cases

* Hospital diagnosis
* Disease registries
* Mass screenings
* As a follow-up to a follow-up study

</div>

<div style="float:right; width:70%;" class="fragment">

### Sourcing controls

1. Random sampling from census block groups
2. Case's close contacts
 * Unless shared exposure of interest
3. Hospital controls
 * May not be from same population
 * May not be representative of exposure
 * Other diseases may cause confounding
4. Controls with other diseases
 * Must be sure to exclude possible related diseases

### Pros and cons

<div style="float:left; width:50%;" class="fragment">

### Pros

* Can work with small sample
* No need to follow subjects over time
* Can estimate RR reasonably well
* Inexpensive
* Can study multiple risk factors simultaneously
* Can provide reasonable support for causation

</div>

<div style="float:right; width:50%;" class="fragment">

### Cons

* Cannot estimate RR (only approximate via OR)
* Can suffer from recall bias
 * Unless based on historical records
* Choosing sources can prove difficult
* Not efficient for studying rare exposures
