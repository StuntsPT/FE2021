### What is Epidemiology?

* &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->The word comes from Greek:
  * &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->*epi* (on or upon)
  * &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->*demos* (people)
  * &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->*logos* (the study of)
* &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->What happens to a population
* &shy;<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->"Study of the distribution and determinants of health related states or events in specified populations and its application to the control of health problems"

### A bit of history

* Jon Snow: 1813-1858
* Cholera: Death rate > 50% without medical attention
* 1830 and 1840
* Cause was unknown (stench and blood were pointed as culprits)
* 1849 - JS links Cholera and digestive system (vomiting and diarrhea)
* *Vibrio choleara*; passed via dirty water
* Tested on the next pandemic
* JS looked at where people who died were getting their water from
  * Southwark and Vauxhall (Thames) company were 14 time more likely to die than Lamberth (Upstream, **before** "sewage")
  * This showed it was waterborne and sanitation would save everyone
* Another JS study - In Soho, where 500 people died of cholera
  * JS went knocking on doors and asking where people got their water from, and wether they had cholera or not;
  * SOHO MAP! JS makred every death; almost all around Broad Street water pump
  * People form the brewery across the street were not sick - they drank beer, not water
  * People who died far way, had passed by the pump on their commute
  * Suzetta Eli was the last link - she lived far, and died, but she loved that water so much, she had it delivered
  * Snow demanded the handle of the pump be removed. It was, and he saved the city. Went to history books as the father of Epidemiology
* How did the well got contaminated?
  * Rev. Henry Whitehead wanted to prove JS wrong - clamied divine intervention
  * Discovered "Patient Zero": A 5 year old who had died of cholera just before the epidemic started.
  * Her mother had washed the vomit and diarrhea in the cesspit next to the pump
* JS was unsure wether removing the pump really made any difference
  * Cases were going down - many dead, many leaving the area out of fear
  * What would have happened if the pump had kept on working?
    * Related with the water companies from earlier
* JS was able to figfure everything out, without treating a single patient. He just used "Big data", and his brains
* Cholera is still an important subject, even today (Haiti 2010)
  * DNA sequencing revealed the starins were similar to those from Nepal, where UN troops had just been summoned from.
  * Sanitation ::down arrow::, cholera ::up arrow::

### "Disease" categories

Concept of pathology
infectoins
environment
genetics


---

### Some key concepts

Concept of infection (replication of a foreign organism != disiese, the clinical symptoms experienced by the host)
Pathogens
Symptomatic and asymptomaic infection
Transmission
Correlation between symptoms and infectiousness
Infectious period
Resistant != susceptible

---

### Transmission

Infectious disieses
* direct 
  * Airborne (droplets, large and small)
  * Sexual (such as HIV)

* inderct (vector transmssion)
  * Intermediate carrier (objects (formite transmssion))
  * Waterborne transmission (like cholera)
  * vectorborne (mosquitos, flies, fleas, etc. (Malaria and dengue, plague))
* Breaking transmision chains

---

### Reproductive number

* How does it start?
  * One person must infectat least one
  * R0
  * Avg. number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual in a population of completely susceptible individuals
* Understangin this pheneomenon helps prevent epidemics from starting, or limiting spread.

* What influences R0:
  * Time an individual is infectious (L, from length)
  * Number of susceptible hosts (S, for susceptible)
  * Transmissibility (Beta):
    * Rate of potentially transmissible ocntacts
    * How likely is a contact to result in transmission?
    * Depends on agent and population characteristics 
* R0 = S * L * Beta
  * Average!!!
* Useful for generalizing, but the start depends a lot on where and in whom an epidemic appears

---

### Epidemic curve

Epidemics are rare events

SIR compartmental framewok (Susceptible, Infected, Removed, over time)
Random meetings assumed (so all SIR types have random contact)

Chain of transmission!
Evolution of this chain depends on R0
Individuals go from susceptible to infected to removed
As susptible pool decreases, an increasing fration of contacts does not lead to new infections

R_E (Effective Reproductive) = R0 * %susceptible population
If R_E < 1 epidemic is self limiting
This happens when % susceptibles in pop falls below 1/R0 -> Herd Immunity

A fraction of the population remains susceptibe as the epidemic self limits itself: Exp(-R0)

Duration of the epidemic depends on:
* duration of infectious period
* latent period (time between being infected and infecting)
