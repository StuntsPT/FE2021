## Epidemic curves (and other models)

---

### Some key concepts

Concept of infection (replication of a foreign organism != disiese, the clinical symptoms experienced by the host)
Pathogens
Symptomatic and asymptomaic infection
Transmission
Correlation between symptoms and infectiousness
Infectious period
Resistant != susceptible

---

### Transmission

Infectious disieses
* direct 
  * Airborne (droplets, large and small)
  * Sexual (such as HIV)

* inderct (vector transmssion)
  * Intermediate carrier (objects (formite transmssion))
  * Waterborne transmission (like cholera)
  * vectorborne (mosquitos, flies, fleas, etc. (Malaria and dengue, plague))
* Breaking transmision chains

---

### Reproductive number

* How does it start?
  * One person must infectat least one
  * R0
  * Avg. number of secondary infections generated by the first infected individual in a population of completely susceptible individuals
* Understangin this pheneomenon helps prevent epidemics from starting, or limiting spread.

* What influences R0:
  * Time an individual is infectious (L, from length)
  * Number of susceptible hosts (S, for susceptible)
  * Transmissibility (Beta):
    * Rate of potentially transmissible ocntacts
    * How likely is a contact to result in transmission?
    * Depends on agent and population characteristics 
* R0 = S * L * Beta
  * Average!!!
* Useful for generalizing, but the start depends a lot on where and in whom an epidemic appears

---

### Epidemic curve

Epidemics are rare events

SIR compartmental framewok (Susceptible, Infected, Removed, over time)
Random meetings assumed (so all SIR types have random contact)

Chain of transmission!
Evolution of this chain depends on R0
Individuals go from susceptible to infected to removed
As susptible pool decreases, an increasing fration of contacts does not lead to new infections

R_E (Effective Reproductive) = R0 * %susceptible population
If R_E < 1 epidemic is self limiting
This happens when % susceptibles in pop falls below 1/R0 -> Herd Immunity

A fraction of the population remains susceptibe as the epidemic self limits itself: Exp(-R0)

Duration of the epidemic depends on:
* duration of infectious period
* latent period (time between being infected and infecting)
