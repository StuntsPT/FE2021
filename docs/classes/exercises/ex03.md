# Class 03 exercises

This class will present you with several exercises on case-control and follow up studies.

## 1. Case-control studies

1. Researchers studying aneurism development conduct a case-control study. Data shows that 90% of the cases lived near cell phone towers. From this data alone, can the researchers conclude that living near cell phone towers increases the risk of developing aneurisms?

2. Researchers conduct a case-control to look for an association between diabetes type 2 and smoking. Data gathered for this study can be found in [this file](https://stuntspt.gitlab.io/FE2021/classes/exercises/diabetes.csv).

* Plot the data of interest however you bet see fit
* Prepare a 2x2 table with these data
* Calculate the exposure odds ratio
* Interpret the exposure odds ratio in a sentence
