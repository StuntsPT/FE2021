# Epidemiology assignment

## Choose a disease - any disease. This should work as your general introduction

* Search the literature for studies on a specific disease
* Describe it in the report (what it is, who it affects, symptoms, known treatments, etc...)


## Find epidemiological studies on this disease

* One paper for at least 4 of the 5 types of study we approached


## Describe the methodology used for each study (Use each paper as a "chapter")

* Compare it with the basic methodology thought in class
 * From a theortical standpoint (no need to dig very deep!)
 * Perform the basic analyses from classes and compare them to the paper's results
* Include any code


## Finish with a general conclusion

* Report each study's highlights
* Report your findings
